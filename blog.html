                <b>1. var:</b> 
                <br><br><b>#Function Scope:</b> Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible within the entire function in which they are declared.
                <br><br><b>#Hoisting:</b> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means they are moved to the top during compilation, and you can use them before their actual declaration in the code.
                <br><br><b>#Reassignment:</b> var variables can be reassigned, and their values can be updated within their scope.
                <br><br><br><b>2. let:</b>
                
                <br><br><b>*Block Scope:</b> Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are accessible only within the nearest enclosing curly braces {} (block) where they are defined. This includes loops, conditional statements, and functions.
                <br><br><b>*No Hoisting:</b> let variables are not hoisted. They are not accessible before their declaration in the code.
                <br><br><b>*Reassignment:</b> let variables can be reassigned, allowing their values to be updated within their scope.
                <br><br><br><b>3. const:</b>
                
                <br><br><b>#Block Scope:</b> Similar to let, variables declared with const are block-scoped and are only accessible within the nearest enclosing curly braces {} (block) where they are defined.
                <br><br><b>#No Hoisting:</b> Like let, const variables are not hoisted and cannot be accessed before their declaration.
                <br><br><b>#Immutable Value:</b> Variables declared with const are constant, meaning their values cannot be reassigned or updated once they are assigned. However, for objects and arrays, while the variable itself cannot be reassigned, the properties or elements within the object or array can be modified.
                <br><br>Understanding the scope and behavior of var, let, and const is essential for writing clean and bug-free JavaScript code. Choosing the appropriate variable declaration keyword depends on the specific use case and the desired behavior of the variable within your code.</p>

                Question 2: Tell us the use cases of <span class="font-black">null</span> and <span class="font-black">undefined</span>

                **<b>null:</b>
                <br><br><b>1. Intentional Absence of a Value:</b> `null` is used to represent the explicit absence of any meaningful value or reference. It indicates that a variable or property intentionally has no assigned value.
                <br><br><b>2. Clearing Variable Values:</b> `null` can be assigned to a variable or object property to reset or clear its value, indicating that there is no valid data assigned.
                <br><br><b>3. Placeholder Value:</b> In some cases, `null` is used as a placeholder value when you want to reserve a spot for a value that will be assigned later.
                <br><br><b>**undefined: </b>
                <br><br><b>1. Implicit Absence of a Value: </b>`undefined` is typically the initial value of a variable or property that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value explicitly. It represents an implicit absence of a value.
                <br><br><b>2. Function Return:</b> Functions that don't explicitly return a value will return `undefined`.
                <br><br><b>3. Missing Object Properties:</b> When you try to access a property that doesn't exist in an object, it will return `undefined`.
                <br><br><b>4. Function Parameters:</b> If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing parameters will be `undefined`.

                Question 3: What do you mean by REST API?

                REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural principles and constraints used for designing and interacting with web services. It is an architectural style that was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000. REST is commonly used in the development of web services, and it relies on a stateless, client-server communication model. </p>
